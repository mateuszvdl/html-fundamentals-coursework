	<h1>HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE</h1>
<p>
Drinking in the day’s first sip of coffee is like paradise massaging the taste buds. It is,
as one coffee-in-a-can company figured out long ago, the best part of waking up. For
a single moment at your favorite coffee shop, or while your fingers hug your favorite
mug in the kitchen, you’ve been taken to the scene of your last vacation – the day’s
worries momentarily melting away, letting you breathe in the serenity of sunshine just
as the caffeine smacks your brain.
</p>

	<h2>MAKING THE PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE REQUIRES TWO ELEMENTS:</h2>
	<h4>The tight coffee & roast</h4>
<p>
Did you know there are over 800 tasting notes and potential flavors found naturally in
coffee? The different roast levels of coffee greatly impact what tasting notes you’ll be
able to discover in the coffee you choose. Like fruity, berry, or tea-like flavors in your
coffee... you should probably stick to the lighter roasts. More of a bold, smokey,
whiskey flavor lover? You probably should stick to the darker side of the roast
spectrum. In the middle (medium roasts) you’ll find a healthy dose of chocolate notes
and a mix of everything in between.

<br>
<br>

Freshness is also SUPER important. That’s why we roast all of our coffees to order
(roasted and shipped) within 24 hours of an order.

	<h4>Getting the finer details right (coffee is only 2 ingredients, coffee & water, so the details matter!</h4>
<p>
Tempting as it may be to throw your grinds in a Mr. Coffee machine and walk away,
it likely won’t produce the results you’re looking for. Show your coffee some love in
the brewing process, though, and it’ll give you heaping amounts – or at least a few tablespoons worth - of love in return

<br>
<br>

Finding the Right Roast

<br>
<br>

Fact: There really is no precise rule on when a roasted coffee is best consumed. But
you can count on a fresh roast producing a quality result. What you’ll want to do in
the search for the right roast and roast age is ask questions of who’s selling you the
roast. Some coffees (many of them, actually) are ones you’ll want to consume within
five days of their roast date for optimal results, while many more are fairly consistent
in quality for about a month after the roast date. But what flavors you extract are
entirely dependent on how porous the beans become over time and how they react to
water. And that’s a giant “question mark” even the most talented barista can’t erase. If
you want to know if your beans are stale, though, pay attention to how it pours in the
cup. If you’re not seeing a head – that slight foam that bubbles at the top of your cup –
you’ve likely waited too long to use your coffee.
</p>

	<h1>GETTING THE RIGHT WATER QUALITY AND TEMPERATURE</h1>
<p>
Though it may not be the most pleasant way to think of it, the flavor profile of your
coffee depends on how much you’re agitating the beans. Or, rather, how much water
is agitating the bean. The temperature of your water is what will matter most in
determining a coffee’s flavor: Pour at a lower temperature (185 degrees) and you’ll
extract fewer of the bean’s nascent flavor notes and end with a more bitter taste; pour
at a higher temperature (205 degrees), and you’ll discover a coffee that’s extracted
more from the bean. This is the process of hydrolysis shaking loose different
compounds in your coffee. Also important, as you might guess, is the quality of the
water you’re using. In short: The fewer the minerals in the water, the better. Because
tap water quality varies from city to city, invest in a top-shelf filter like a Brita. Also,
never re-boil water that’s been through the heating process (yes, we know how
convenient it is to leave water in a kettle), and wait about 30 seconds after heating
your water to actually begin pouring over your coffee. And, if you really want to be a
chemist about it, test your water to make sure it’s in the range of pH 7.
</p>

	<h1>GET YOUR GRIND ON</h1>
<p>
Not all grinds are the same; there is no one-size-fits-all grind size for making a quality
cup of coffee. And, in truth, what constitutes the “right grind” is entirely based on
your taste preference. But you do need a grinder. The two basics to consider when
grinding your coffee: Do you want a sweeter cup, and do you want a caffeinated cup?
A finer grind – which means smaller particles with a larger surface area to slow the
movement of water -- will extract more of a coffee’s flavor notes, while a coarse grind
will produce a cup that packs a Mike Tyson-level caffeine punch. Also, if you’re
using an older roast, you’ll almost always want to aim for a finer grind to ensure
you’re getting as much flavor as possible. Mixing coffee grinds, too, can ruin your
perfect-cup-chasing effort. To avoid this, clean your grinder after every use, even if
it’s just a tap-tap to the machine to shake loose bean debris. It might not be obvious,
but those leftover coffee grinds from last Sunday’s brunch will make your fresh roast
a lot more bitter. One last point of note for grinding: There is also no standard system
for grind settings – as ideal as that might be, in a coffee utopia. A “4” on your
machine might be a 12 on a different one. Womp womp.
</p>

	<h1>THE IMPACT OF BREW METHODS</h1>
<p>
Naturally, one of the biggest variables in how your cup comes out is what you’re
using to pour. Use a Chemex – or any similar pour-over tool – and you’ll concoct a
cup that’s silkier and generally more acidic. (Or “brighter,” if you’ve heard the term
before.) It’s the preferred method for coffees that have citrus or floral notes; with a
Chemex filter, coffee is less exposed to water and all-around less bitter. By
comparison, a French Press – which no one can definitively say was invented in
France, by the way – will produce an oilier, more full-bodied cup of coffee. Think:
More velvet than silk. Because it’s a steeping method, you’re likely to get a more
consistent taste with a French Press, regardless of roast or targeted coffee flavor notes.
But it’s especially ideal for an earthier coffee. Percolators and batch brews,
meanwhile, will offer a reasonably consistent result for your coffee, but also offer less
control over the process. Meanwhile, an AeroPress – by all means it’s own beast to
tackle – will give you more of a hybrid of the Chemex and a French Press methods,
offering up an abundance of versatility with how it’s used.

	<h1>HOW TO BREW A CUP OF PARADISE (JOE) USING A FRENCH PRESS</h1>
<p>
Finally, here’s the step-by-step of what you need to know to brew your ideal cup –
using a French Press. Outside of the coffee machine that might still be lingering in
your pantry from the ‘80s, the French Press is what most of us will be familiar with as
manual brewing. So, here’s a rundown of what you need to do to perfect your cup (or
two) of coffee.
</p>
	<h3>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</h3>
<ul>
	<li>High-quality coffee beans
	<li>French press
	<li>Ground coffee
	<li>Tablespoon or scale
	<li>Kettle
</ul>
	<h3>STEPS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Measure your coffee. The standard ratio is approximately 2 tablespoons of
coffee per 6 ounces of water. Don’t be afraid to add a few extra beans to be on
the safe side – you can more approximately measure out your coffee using a
scale after it’s ground.
<li>Grind your coffee. Alright, this is where the coffee-making process really
begins. Go for a finer roast if you want a sweeter cup of coffee, or a coarser
grind if you’re aiming for a satisfying, weighty bitter. Make sure the grinder is
clean before using, then feel free to press the magic button.
<li>Prepare the water. You’ll want to prepare the water last, to ensure the water is
the temperature you’re aiming for. Pour from the filter, and let the water sit off
from the boil for about 30 seconds before immersing your coffee grounds in the
French Press.
<li>Pour. Saturate the grounds evenly with a smooth, steady pour that will agitate
the coffee grounds. Do not put the lid on top of the brewer just yet.
<li>Soak and stir. Let the grounds absorb the water for approximately 30 seconds
before stirring – a few gentle motions using the back of a spoon around the top
layer of the mixture and along the sides, to immerse any grounds that are stuck.
<li>Brew. Let the water extract from the grounds for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
Less than that, and you’ll find your coffee may be too sweet or even sour. Any
longer, and your coffee will be over-extracted and unappetizingly bitter – so,
set a timer.
<li>Plunge. There really is no wrong way to push here – just a simple, even push-
through of the filter down to the bottom. However, it’s not a clogged toilet –
don’t exert too much force or, of course, your coffee will splash. Or you may
break the machine, if it’s glass.
<li>Pour.
</ol>
	<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>
Just like paradise is in the eye of the beholder, so too is the perfect cup of coffee. The
joy of coffee – beyond those transporting effects its caffeine kick offers in the
morning – is how much experimentation is involved. It’s the ultimate test of trial and
error. Don’t be afraid to experiment with grind sizes, coffee roasts, water temperatures
and brew methods until you find your “just right” cup of coffee. Let your taste buds
be the map to paradise.
