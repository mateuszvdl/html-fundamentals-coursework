# Web Fundamentals Coursework (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

Welcome to my web fundamentals repository! This collection showcases my initial projects from a university course, tracking my journey as I learn the core concepts of web development â€” from structuring pages with HTML, to styling them with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript and p5.js.

## Projects Included

### HTML Basics

- `index-intro.html` 
  A demonstration page that includes a variety of basic HTML elements such as headings, ordered and unordered lists, tables, divs, images, and links.

- `Coffee.html` 
  A text-based page that practices content formatting. It contains an article on how to make coffee, structured with paragraphs and headings.

- `My_page.html` 
  A creative "About Me" page that uses images to answer a series of personal questions, demonstrating the use of the `<img>` tag.

### Introduction to CSS

- `Strefy_SWPS.html` & `css/styles.css`  
  A project that introduces Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style a web page. It demonstrates how to use an external stylesheet to control layout, colors, fonts, and create interactive hover effects for navigation.

### JavaScript Fundamentals

- `intro_to_JS.html` 
  This file introduces basic JavaScript for client-side interactivity. It demonstrates how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change content and styles based on user events, like button clicks.

- `index-coffee.html` 
  An interactive ordering page for a coffee shop. This project uses JavaScript to manage state (the user's order) and dynamically update the page as the user adds or removes items.

- `quiz.html`  
  A simple, interactive quiz that uses JavaScript to check user answers and provide immediate feedback by changing the color of the text.

### p5.js Projects

- `whack-a-rabbit.html`  
  A simple "Whack-a-Mole" style game built with the p5.js library. This project uses files in the `scripts/` and `images/` folders and demonstrates handling user input (mouse clicks), managing game state (score), and creating simple animations on an HTML canvas.

## How to Use

To view these web pages, you can either:

- **Open them directly in your browser**  
  After cloning the repository, open each `.html` file directly in a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari to see the rendered page.

- **Use a live server**  
  For a better development experience, use a tool like the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code to host the files locally.

> **Note:**  
> For some pages to display correctly, their associated CSS, JavaScript, and image files must be in the correct subfolders: `css/`, `scripts/`, and `images/`.
