# HTML Fundamentals Coursework

This repository contains a collection of my first projects from a university course on HTML. It showcases the fundamental skills of web page creation, including text formatting, structuring content, and linking between pages.

## Projects Included

This repository contains the following HTML files:

- **index-5.html**  
  A demonstration page that includes a variety of basic HTML elements such as headings, ordered and unordered lists, tables, divs, images, and links.

- **Coffee.html**  
  A text-based page that practices content formatting. It contains an article on how to make coffee, structured with paragraphs and headings.

- **My page.html**  
  A creative "About Me" page that uses images to answer a series of personal questions, demonstrating the use of the `<img>` tag.

## How to Use

To view these web pages, you can either:

- **Open them directly in your browser**  
  After cloning the repository, open each `.html` file directly in a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari to see the rendered page.

- **Use a live server**  
  For a better development experience, use a tool like the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code to host the files locally.
