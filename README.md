# Web Fundamentals Coursework (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

Welcome to my web fundamentals repository! This collection showcases my initial projects from a university course, tracking my journey as I learn the core concepts of web development â€” from structuring pages with HTML, to styling them with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Projects Included

### HTML Basics

- `index-5.html`  
  A demonstration page that includes a variety of basic HTML elements such as headings, ordered and unordered lists, tables, divs, images, and links.

- `Coffee.html` 
  A text-based page that practices content formatting. It contains an article on how to make coffee, structured with paragraphs and headings.

- `My page.html`
  A creative "About Me" page that uses images to answer a series of personal questions, demonstrating the use of the `<img>` tag.

### Introduction to CSS

- `Strefy SWPS.html` & `styles.css` 
  A project that introduces Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style a web page. It demonstrates how to use an external stylesheet to control layout, colors, fonts, and create interactive hover effects for navigation.

### Introduction to JavaScript

- `intro_to_JS.html`  
  This file introduces JavaScript for client-side interactivity. It demonstrates how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change content and styles based on user events, like button clicks.

## How to Use

To view these web pages, you can either:

- **Open them directly in your browser**  
  After cloning the repository, open each `.html` file directly in a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari to see the rendered page.

- **Use a live server**  
  For a better development experience, use a tool like the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code to host the files locally.

> **Note:**  
> For the `Strefy SWPS.html` page to display correctly:
> - The `styles.css` file must be located in a `css/` subfolder.  
> - Any images must be stored in an `images/` subfolder.
